### Hi, I am Elohim! ðŸ˜€
- âœ¨ Right now I'm interested in creative programming and how to automate stuff. For creative programming I have been learning Chuck that is a [programming  language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu) and Processing is a [flexible software sketchbook and a      language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts](https://processing.org). Finally, to automate boring stuff I use Python (one of the most used languages in the world). When I began to learn Python, my mindset (in the context of tech) growed up beacuse I began to interact with the operating system and that's was wonderful to me. It opened the world of be better on CLI. I needed to automate repetitive things that occurring when I was programing in Processing, but no just in it, also in automate my work process and save time. 

  For the long term I have interest in decentralzced internet and machine learning. 

- ðŸŒ± My stack to learning and practice:
  * Now books:
    * Automte The Boring Stuff with Python
    * Learn Python the Hard Way 
    * Learnig Processing a Begginer's Guide to Programming Images
    * Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists
    * Processing a Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists
  * To improve my programming skills I am going to rethink and retype my code from courses that I been taken:
    * [~~Programming for the visual arts~~](https://github.com/elohimgv/programming-for-visual-arts-processing-version)
    * [Introduction to Real Time Audio Programming in Chuck](https://github.com/elohimgv/audio-programming-in-chuck)
  * Personal projects that must be refactored: 
    * [Proyecto uker](https://github.com/elohimgv/proyecto_uker)
    * [Study drills in Chuck](https://github.com/elohimgv/study-drills-in-chuck)
  * Future books:
    * Learn Python the Hard Way
    * Introduction to Computing 
    * The Nature of Code
    * [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com)
    * [~~Programming Design Systems~~](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/introduction/)
  * Maybe, future courses to be taken:  
    * [Using Python to Interact with the Operating System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-operating-system)
    * [Software Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/software-testing--cs258)
    * [ProgramaciÃ³n Orientada a Objetos con Python](https://es.coursera.org/learn/programacion-python-objetos?=)
    * [Physics Based Sound Synthesis](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/physics-based-sound-synthesis-for-games-and-interactive-systems-iv/info)
    * [Machine Learning for Musicians and Artists](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/machine-learning-for-musicians-and-artists-v/info)
    
   It depends on what I needed in future. I reprogrammed my brain to think in systems not in objectives more like complex systems. I learned this with          [Barbara Oakley](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) in Learnig how to Learn course. This did improve my mental health reducing stress    and anxious. Now I work more on needs and less desires been concious of my capacities, boundaries and avoided to try to do more that what I can. Always      hearing the voice of my heart not to compare myself with another programmer for doing something better than me or even more experienced or because the      industry (society) demands certain characteristics in a programmer.
