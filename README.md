### Hi, I am Elohim! ðŸ˜€
- âœ¨ IÂ´m interested in creative programming, decentralized internet and machine learning (in progress to learn...). And I feel good when explore how my conscious and unconscious  mind act ðŸ”¥ to beat things that I feel bad. I like to learn new things, but the most important thing to me is to transform my interior. I donÂ´t tag mysefl in a professional profile... just I define me how _integrator of experiences_.
