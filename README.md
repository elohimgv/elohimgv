### Hi, I am Elohim! ðŸ˜€
âœ¨ I'm aspiring to be a full-stack developer. I am studying on the [Platzi](https://platzi.com) platform. I began my journey to the tech world by studying with teachers like [Dan Shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/) and [David J. Malan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Malan). To be a good developer I found that  I needed to reframe my mind that's where [Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/) appears with her courses [Learn how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?=) and [Mindshift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift?=). To me is important... how say, the futurist [David Houle](https://blog.kannu.com/digital-learning/david-houle-change-the-only-constant/) 
> The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read or write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn

For the long term, I have an interest in data science.
