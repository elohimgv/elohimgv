### Hi, I am Elohim! ðŸ˜€
âœ¨ I'm interested in creative programming. I began my journey learned [Chuck](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu) that is a programming  language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation and [Processing](https://processing.org), it is a flexible software sketchbook and a      language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts and a little bit of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) the version of Processing for the web.

I found that it's important to know how to automate some process on my workflow. That's the reason why I decided to studied Python; it's a scripting language and a good option for these tasks. 

For the long term I have interest in decentralized internet and machine learning.
