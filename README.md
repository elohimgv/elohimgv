### Hi, I am Elohim! ðŸ˜€
âœ¨ I'm interested in web development and creative code. I began my journey learned [Chuck](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu) that is a programming  language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation and [Processing](https://processing.org), it is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts and a little bit of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) the version of Processing for the web.

For the long term I have interest in data science.
