### Hi, I am Elohim! ðŸ˜€
âœ¨ I'm interested in creative programming. I began my journey learned Chuck that is a [programming  language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu) and Processing, it is a [flexible software sketchbook and a      language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts](https://processing.org) and a little bit of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) the version of Processing for the web.

I found that it's important to know how to automate some process on my workflow. That's the reason why I decided to studied Python; it's a scripting language and a good option for these tasks.
